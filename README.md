# Project Title: Electrical Power Consumption Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the resources and code related to **Electrical Power Consumption Analysis**. The project aims to analyze and model electrical power consumption patterns to gain insights and make predictions based on historical data.

Included in this repository:
1. **Manuscript** - A comprehensive report detailing the objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
2. **Dataset** - The raw data used for analysis and modeling.
3. **Jupyter Notebook** - Contains code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building.

## Contents
- **manuscript.pdf**: The detailed research paper for the project, covering background, methods, results, and insights.
- **data.csv**: The dataset used for analysis and model training, containing electrical power consumption data with various attributes such as timestamps, power usage, and relevant external factors.
- **notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook file containing all code, including data loading, cleaning, exploration, and modeling.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/priyank206/Electrical-Power-Consumption.git
   cd Electrical-Power-Consumption
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python installed. The project requires several libraries, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`. You can install them with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```

## Dataset Description
The dataset **data.csv** includes the following columns:
- `timestamp`: Timestamp of the recording.
- `power_usage`: Power consumption in kilowatts.
- `temperature`: External temperature, which might impact power usage.
- `humidity`: Humidity level.
- `[additional columns in your dataset]`

For more information on each field, please refer to the **Data Dictionary** section in the manuscript.

## Analysis Workflow
The Jupyter notebook follows this structure:
1. **Data Loading**: Load and inspect the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and create new features if necessary.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize and analyze key features.
4. **Modeling**: Build and evaluate predictive models using techniques such as **linear regression, decision trees, etc.**.
5. **Results**: Interpret model performance and summarize findings.
